- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArturoBell
- 👀 I’m interested in merging marine ecology with data science, going farther than the classical null-hypothesis testing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to implement machine learning algorithms to ecological problems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on marine mammal ecology projects.
